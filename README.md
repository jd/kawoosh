An HTTP REST gateway to IRC.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jd/kawoosh.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jd/kawoosh)

The goal of this project is to provide a stateless access to IRC via an HTTP
REST interface. It will also leverage features like searching into logs via
this same REST interface, and all common IRC operations.
